He is claiming that he was expecting a refund on some banking fees he was wrongly charged for but he has not received them. He explains that a colleague of yours promised the refund would be in his account today but the money has not arrived yet. He is getting more upset and is raising his voice to you. What would you say to him?

## Question 2

You are working as a graduate trainee in an electronics company and are currently part of an international project team looking at new routes to market. During a conference call you are finding it difficult to understand what one of your colleagues is saying. She is a graduate trainee like you and you have met her a few times during a couple of conferences you both attended and you got on well. Her accent is very strong and she has a tendency to speak very quickly when she is nervous. She is one of a number of people dialling in from outside of the UK. You are in a meeting room with the project lead and a couple of other colleagues. You can see that your colleagues are also finding it difficult to understand her. What would you do?

* When your colleague is no longer speaking, send her an instant message explaining that she may benefit from slowing down a little as there are a few people who are finding it difficult to understand her in the room where you are.

## Question 3

You recently submitted a paper to an upcoming professional conference that will be attended by many people from your industry and from universities globally. You have attended the conference in the past and it is very well attended and highly regarded in the industry. The paper is a summary of some very complex research you have been undertaking with some key findings that you believe people will find very interesting and useful. Upon learning that it has been accepted, your manager asks you to think about how you will present your findings in order to make the biggest impact. You only have a short time slot for your presentation. How would you respond?

## Question 4

 As part of your graduate training scheme with a large energy company you have been undertaking a variety of placements with different departments in the business. You are close to finishing a really successful placement in the Procurement team and will be moving onto the Finance team in a week's time. At lunchtime a colleague from Procurement, who you have become quite close to, takes you aside and warns you that there are a number of people in the Finance team who she has had problems with in the past. She says that there are people in Finance who are not to be trusted in her view and that you would be better off avoiding them if you can. What would you say?

* 'What makes you think they can’t be trusted? What advice can you offer about how to work with them?'

 Most
 `Least`

* 'What are you basing that opinion on? Could it be that you misinterpreted their actions or intentions towards you?'

 Most
 Least

* 'I don’t think it is appropriate for you to talk about people in this manner and I’m afraid it’s probably best if we end this conversation now.'

 Most
 Least

* 'Thanks for flagging that but it’s probably better if I go there with an open mind rather than having preconceptions about my future colleagues.'

## Question 7

Your position as a graduate trainee with a global bank means that you are currently working in a high street branch.
