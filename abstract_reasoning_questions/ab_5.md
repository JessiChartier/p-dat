# Abstract Reasoning Q5

Which tile belongs in the blank space?

 A
 `B`
 C
 D

Solution
The position of the orange circle within each tile is relative to the tilesâ€™ position in the wider image. Therefore the circle in the centre tile would be positioned in the middle of the tile. The arrow is also rotating in an anti-clockwise direction as you move from left to right.
