# Abstract Reasoning Q3

Which shape is the odd one out?

 A
 B
 `C`
 D
 E
 F
 G
 H

Solution
This question is asking you to identify a rule that applies to all but one shape. Things to consider include what shapes are present, how many shapes are present, relative position, colour.

In this example, there are 2 consistent rules: the largest shape is consistently the same colour and the shape closest to the bottom of each square is orange. There is only one square that the latter rule doesnâ€™t apply to.
