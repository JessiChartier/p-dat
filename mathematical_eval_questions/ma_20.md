In which year were the bike accessories sales higher than $20 million?

* 2018
* 2019
* 2025
* 2021
* 2022

## Solution

* Step 1 - Calculate the Total bikes sales ﬁgure for each year Multiply Number of bikes sold by Average sales price
  * 2022 = $96,583,900
  * 2021 = $82,325,200
  * 2020 = $86,718,000
  * 2019 = $94,261,400
  * 2018 = $85,904,800
* Step 2 - Subtract Step 1's ﬁgures from the annual sales ﬁgures given (motorbikes and accessories)
  * $101,300,000 - $96,583,900 = $4,716,100
  * $106,200,000 - $82,325,200 = $23,874,800
  * $104,500,000 - $86,718,000 = $17,782,000
  * $106,100,000 - $94,261,400 = $11,838,600
  * $103,800,000 - $85,904,800 = $17,895,200
* Step 3 - Review Step 2 totals to establish which year is higher than $20 million

`Thus the correct answer is (D), 2021`
