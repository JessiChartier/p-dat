# Question 16

## Quality Control for New Components

||Pass|Fail|Total
|---------|------|-----|-----|
|Component A|52|42|94|
|Component B|45|72|117|
|Component C|74|24|98|
|Total|171|138|309|

Based on the 309 components. It is now discovered that the Components C that failed were double counted, what is now the probability that a randomly chosen component is Component C and fails the test.

* 0.5
* 0.04
* 0.03452
* 0.02452

## Solution

* Therefore there were only half (24/2=12) 12 components that were component C and failed the test.
* We must adjust the total, which should now be 12 less, therefore 309-12=297. Hence the probability is 12/297 = `0.04`
