In which one year, or two-year period, was there a 10% change in the number of bikes sold, when compared to the previous year?

* 2021-2022
* 2020-2022
* 2019-2020
* 2020-2018
* None of the above
  
## Solution

* Step 1 - Calculate the % change between each of the 5 years shown
  * 2021/22 = 18.1%
  * 2020/21 = - 8.5%
  * 2019/20 = 13.1%
  * 2018/19 = -1.5%
* Step 2 - Calculate the % change between each of the possible 2-years spans
  * 2020-2022 = 8.1%
  * 2021-2019 = 3.5%
  * 2020-2018 = 11.5%
* Step 3 - Review to Ô¨Ånd the answer (ignoring whether there was an increase or decrease in the number of bikes sold)

`Thus the correct answer is (E), None of the above`
