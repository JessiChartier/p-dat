One of the years shown had a total production cost of $50 million (to the nearest $1,000). What was the total bikes sales figure for that year (to the nearest $100,000)?

* $86,000,000
* $85,900,000
* $85,905,000
* $85,500,000
* $85,000,000

## Solution

* Step 1 - Calculate the production costs for each year Multiply Number of bikes sold by Average production cost
* 2022 = $64,561,000
* 2021 = $56,223,750
* 2020 = $53,759,200
* 2019 = $54,055,490
* 2018 = $49,966,400 = $50 million (to the nearest $1,000)
* Step 2 - Review to establish the year in question Year 2018
* Step 3 - Find the Total bikes sales Ô¨Ågure for that year
* Multiply Number of bikes sold by Average sales price
* = 13,360 x $6,430
* = $85,904,800 = $85,900,000 (to the nearest $100,000)

* `Thus the correct answer is (B), $85,900,000`
