If Japanese GDP per capita was forecast to increase 20% from 2022 to 2023 but it only achieved 80% of the forecast increase, what was the GDP per capita in 2023? (to the nearest $)

* $49,684
* $51,687
* $53,098
* $55,851
  
## Solution

* Japan GDP per capita in 2022 = $45,774
* Forecast to increase 20%, therefore:
* $45,774 × 1.2 = $54,928.8

* An increase of $54,928.8 - $45,774 = $9,154.80

* Only 80% of the increase took place so:
* $9,154.8 × 0.8 = $7,323.84

* There GDP in 2023 = $7,323.84 + $45,774 = `$53,098`
