In 2021, the manufacturer produces at the same ratio of total cost : sales price as in 2019. By what percentage did the sales price differ from that shown in the table for 2021 (to the nearest %)?

* 10%
* 22%
* 7%
* 21%
* 5%

## Solution

* Step 1 - Find the Total cost for 2019
* Production cost + Other costs = $4,106 + $1,746 = $5,852
* Step 2 - Convert this Ô¨Ågure to a % of sales price
* $5,852 / $7,160 = 81.7%
* Step 3 - Put this % into an equation (containing 2021 data) where Z = answer
* (4,125 + 489) / 0.8173 = Z
* Z = $5,645.42 (to 2 decimal places)
* Step 4, the percentage difference between the new 2021 price and old 2021 price:
* (5645.42 - 6040) / 6040 x 100 = 6.53% to 2 d.p

`Thus the correct answer is (C), 7%`
