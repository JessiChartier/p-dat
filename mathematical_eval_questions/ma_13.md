# Question 13

## Quality Control for New Components

||Pass|Fail|Total
|---------|------|-----|-----|
|Component A|52|42|94|
|Component B|45|72|117|
|Component C|74|24|98|
|Total|171|138|309|

Based on these 309 components, what is the probability that a randomly chosen component passes the test?

* 0.5534
* 0.6752
* 0.4215
* 0.7145

## Solution

`We look at how many components passed the test, and we look at how many components there are in total. 171 components passed the test out of 309 therefore the probability is 171/309 = 0.5534.`
