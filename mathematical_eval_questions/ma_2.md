## Heathrow Airport Cargo per Airport

|Tonnes per Hour|February|March|April|May|
|-------------|---------|------|-----|-----|
|0 - 1.99|104|127|172|143|
|2.00 - 3.99|102|127|186|195|
|4.00 - 5.99|149|158|178|209|
|6.00 - 7.99|93|106|109|120|
|8.00 - 9.99|49|52|87|95|

What is the difference between the number of flights carrying â‰¥ 4 tonnes of cargo in February compared to May?

* 50
* 84
* 108
* 133

## Solution

Total greater than 4 tonnes in:

* February = 149 + 93 + 49 = 291
* May =  209 + 120 + 95 = 424

`424 - 291 = 133`
