# Question 14

## Quality Control for New Components

||Pass|Fail|Total
|---------|------|-----|-----|
|Component A|52|42|94|
|Component B|45|72|117|
|Component C|74|24|98|
|Total|171|138|309|

Based on these 309 components, what is the probability that a randomly chosen component is A and fails the test?

* 0.3542
* 0.4527
* 0.1254
* 0.1359

## Solution

`We look at what the probability that the chosen component is A and fails the test, i.e. go to that square in the 2 way table, this could be one of 42 components out of 309.
Therefore the probability is 42/309=0.1359`
